								<h3>OUR VISION</h3><hr>
                                <p>To create an online platform where sellers can advertise their properties for sale and buyers are able to connect to developers and sellers of properties by a simple one time connection fee of 55k which will relieve the buyers from the supposed AGENCY FEES of 5%.</p>

								<br>
								<p><strong>The 55k connection fee on connectseller website is not agency fee but a token to ensure buyers effective seriousness and readiness to buy a property. The buyer can get a refund of 50k when we find it difficult to connect him/her to a seller or developer who has the property that is ideal for the buyer. We are very confident in our developer/seller contacts. Every buyer is assured to find their desired property on the website.</strong></p>
